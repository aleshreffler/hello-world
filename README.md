Getting to know Github
My name is Alex. I am failing at staying *FOCUSED*, but I am trying to do better!

My goal is to understand more about GitHub in the next few hours. 

This is my second edit to synthesize my thoughts about the GitHub process:

The repository is the place where I keep the files. 

The main branch is the "production" version of my file collection. 

The forked branch is the one that I can edit freely without worrying about affects to the main branch and possible overlaps with other people. 

When I am done editing my branch, I will commit (save) and then I can choose to submit a pull request, which is proposing changes and asking others to review.
- i.e. pulling in my contributions to the main project/repository. 
*diffs* = differences | red = removed, green = added

@ mention system gets users' attention
